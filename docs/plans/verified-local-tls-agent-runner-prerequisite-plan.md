# Verified Local TLS For Agent-Container API Test Runs Plan

Make the host-managed local Tilt/Kind HTTPS ingress verifiable from the shared
agent container without weakening TLS behavior. The host will publish only its
public mkcert root CA certificate, the workspace devcontainer will provide a
lazy idempotent command that installs that CA into the trust stores used by
command-line and browser clients, and the standalone API test repository will
invoke that command for exact-local bootstrap before its typed prerequisite
check performs live traffic.

Status: Proposed blocking prerequisite

This work must complete before resuming Phase 5 of
[`provider-neutral-session-and-api-coverage-completion-plan.md`](../../../budget-analyzer-api-tests/docs/plans/provider-neutral-session-and-api-coverage-completion-plan.md).
It is deliberately outside that plan because certificate publication and agent
container trust are owned by orchestration and workspace, not by the black-box
test harness.

## Repository Ownership And Execution Order

| Phase | Owning repository | Ownership boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `orchestration` | Host certificate setup and publication of the public mkcert root CA |
| 2 | `workspace` | Lazy agent-container system, Python, curl, and Chromium trust installation |
| 3 | `budget-analyzer-api-tests` | Exact-local lazy trust bootstrap, mandatory TLS verification, and live-test prerequisite diagnostics |
| 4 | `budget-analyzer-api-tests` | Cross-repository acceptance and provider-neutral plan handoff |

Each phase must be implemented from its owning repository after reading that
repository's nearest `AGENTS.md`. Completion of one phase does not authorize an
agent working in that repository to implement a later phase owned elsewhere.
This is a coordination plan, not a single cross-repository AI Session Handler
run: the handler infers its writable workspace from the plan location. Each
owner should execute only its assigned phase from its own repository, using an
owner-local execution plan when automation is desired.

## Resolved Design Decisions

1. Local Tilt/Kind is a production-parity deployment path. Live tests must use
   HTTPS and verify the ingress certificate.
2. The agent container consumes the same host-generated mkcert trust anchor as
   the host workstation. It must not generate or rotate browser-facing
   certificates.
3. The only new material copied from the host mkcert CA directory by this plan
   is `rootCA.pem`, the public CA certificate. `rootCA-key.pem` remains on the
   host and must never be copied, mounted, logged, or committed. Existing local
   development key and Secret visibility is governed by decision 8 rather than
   presented as a confidentiality boundary.
4. Orchestration publishes the public root CA at a deterministic ignored path
   under its existing local certificate directory. The workspace is already
   mounted into the agent container, so no host-home bind mount is required.
5. The workspace image provides `ensure-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust`, an
   explicit idempotent command that installs or refreshes the public CA in the
   operating-system trust bundle and the Chromium/NSS trust database. It also
   configures Python HTTPS clients to use the combined system bundle. The
   container does not require or install the CA at startup.
6. The API test repository has no `verify_tls` environment setting, insecure
   pytest option, environment-variable bypass, or target-specific exception.
7. Offline collection, harness unit tests, and snapshot coverage remain
   independent of a live target. Automatic live prerequisite checks run only
   when selected tests or tools will access a deployed environment.
8. The agent container is inside the trusted local-development boundary. It
   already has access to the shared workspace, local Kind kubeconfig and
   Kubernetes Secrets, generated development TLS private keys, and any local
   API-test credentials deliberately supplied to a run. This plan does not
   claim those local materials are confidential from the agent.
9. That trust boundary is local-only. No staging or production kubeconfig,
   cloud or deployment credential, user credential, or session cookie may be
   supplied to the agent container, and an agent session must never deploy or
   administer staging or production.
10. `rootCA.pem` is public trust material, not a credential. It can contain
    locally identifying subject metadata and a stable fingerprint, so it stays
    ignored by Git and out of uploaded artifacts and logs. The corresponding
    `rootCA-key.pem` remains prohibited.
11. Agent-run acceptance for this plan must fail closed unless the API-test
    configuration declares `environment_type: local` and targets exactly
    `https://app.budgetanalyzer.localhost`. Any plan-authorized cluster mutation
    must additionally verify the local Kind identity using checks appropriate
    to its execution side: host commands verify `kind-kind` plus the host Kind
    cluster named `kind`; in-container commands verify the context, referenced
    cluster, loopback API endpoint, and `kind-control-plane` node through
    `kubectl`.
12. The API-test live prerequisite/bootstrap path may invoke the workspace
    ensure command only after its resolved configuration declares
    `environment_type: local` and the exact origin
    `https://app.budgetanalyzer.localhost`. Staging, production, aliases, and
    arbitrary origins never trigger local trust-store installation.

## Phase 1: Orchestration Publishes The Host mkcert Root

### Goal

Extend the supported host TLS setup so the shared workspace contains a current,
public copy of the mkcert root CA that signed the local ingress certificate.

### Scope

- Update `scripts/bootstrap/setup-k8s-tls.sh`, which must continue to run only
  on the host workstation.
- Before reading, deleting, or creating Kubernetes resources, fail closed
  unless `kubectl config current-context` is exactly `kind-kind` and `kind get
  clusters` contains the expected `kind` cluster. A reachable Kubernetes API
  alone is not sufficient proof of the local target.
- After resolving `mkcert -CAROOT` and confirming `rootCA.pem` exists, publish
  it to a deterministic path such as:

  ```text
  nginx/certs/k8s/_mkcert-rootCA.pem
  ```

- Copy atomically with public-certificate permissions and make repeated setup
  runs idempotent.
- Validate that the source is a parseable CA certificate and that its subject
  matches the issuer of the generated wildcard ingress certificate.
- Never copy `rootCA-key.pem`; reject any implementation that handles the CA
  private key.
- Extend the host prerequisite/status output to name the published public CA
  path and give a clear remediation when it is absent or stale.
- Keep the published PEM ignored by Git and document that it is public local
  trust material generated by host setup. Do not print its subject or issuer in
  routine status output because mkcert commonly embeds local user or device
  metadata.
- Update `AGENTS.md` so in-container agents working in this repository may run
  the workspace `ensure-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust` command for the exact
  local origin, must stop for host `./setup.sh` when publication is missing,
  and remain forbidden from generating or rotating certificates in-container.
- Update the closest orchestration setup documentation and script catalog.

### Non-goals

- Do not run mkcert or certificate-generation scripts from the agent
  container.
- Do not change the Kubernetes TLS Secret format or put the mkcert root into
  the cluster Secret.
- Do not publish the CA private key or any application/session secret.
- Do not weaken browser, curl, Python, ingress, or Kubernetes TLS settings.
- Do not add manual live-cluster drift as a durable solution.

### Required context

- `AGENTS.md`, especially the host-only certificate constraints
- `scripts/bootstrap/setup-k8s-tls.sh`
- `scripts/bootstrap/check-tilt-prerequisites.sh`
- `scripts/README.md`
- `docs/development/getting-started.md`
- `docs/development/local-environment.md`
- `.gitignore`
- the sibling workspace trust-consumer contract described by Phase 2

### Implementation notes

- Prefer `install` to a temporary file followed by an atomic rename so a
  container never reads a partially written PEM.
- Compare certificate fingerprints or file content before replacing the
  published copy so unchanged setup runs remain quiet and stable.
- Validate CA basic constraints where the available OpenSSL version supports a
  portable check.
- Keep the existing `assert_host_execution` guard before all mkcert and
  certificate publication work.
- The published filename must not resemble or include a private-key filename.

### Validation

Agent-safe static validation:

```bash
bash -n scripts/bootstrap/setup-k8s-tls.sh
shellcheck scripts/bootstrap/setup-k8s-tls.sh
bash -n scripts/bootstrap/check-tilt-prerequisites.sh
shellcheck scripts/bootstrap/check-tilt-prerequisites.sh
git check-ignore nginx/certs/k8s/_mkcert-rootCA.pem
```

Required host acceptance, performed outside the agent container:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap/setup-k8s-tls.sh
test -r nginx/certs/k8s/_mkcert-rootCA.pem
openssl x509 -in nginx/certs/k8s/_mkcert-rootCA.pem -noout
cmp "$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem" nginx/certs/k8s/_mkcert-rootCA.pem
openssl verify \
  -CAfile nginx/certs/k8s/_mkcert-rootCA.pem \
  nginx/certs/k8s/_wildcard.budgetanalyzer.localhost.pem
```

The implementation may compare subject and issuer internally, but acceptance
output must not print those fields. Use parse success, fingerprint equality,
and `openssl verify` as the recorded evidence.

Review the resulting repository state and confirm that no mkcert
`rootCA-key.pem` copy is present or tracked.

### Completion criteria

- Host TLS setup publishes an exact, readable copy of `rootCA.pem` at the
  documented ignored path.
- The published CA verifies the wildcard ingress certificate.
- Re-running host setup without certificate changes is idempotent.
- The host-only execution guard remains effective.
- The script refuses Kubernetes mutation unless the active target is the
  expected local `kind-kind` context backed by the `kind` cluster.
- No mkcert CA private key or new secret crosses into the workspace.
- Orchestration documentation names the publication contract consumed by the
  workspace repository.
- Orchestration agent guidance distinguishes allowed lazy installation of the
  published public CA from forbidden in-container certificate generation.

## Phase 2: Workspace Provides Lazy Trust Installation

### Goal

Make a rebuilt agent image capable of installing or refreshing the published
host mkcert CA on demand, without requiring the CA at container startup or a
container restart after host publication or rotation.

### Scope

- Add the required CA/NSS tooling to `ai-agent-sandbox/Dockerfile`, including
  `libnss3-tools` when `certutil` is not already available.
- Add an idempotent workspace-owned command at
  `ai-agent-sandbox/scripts/ensure-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust.sh` and
  install it in the image as `ensure-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust`.
- Only when explicitly invoked, have the ensure command locate the
  deterministic orchestration artifact from Phase 1 and validate that it is a
  parseable CA certificate before trusting it.
- Install or refresh the CA under a stable name in the container
  operating-system trust store and run the platform trust-store update only
  when required.
- Import or refresh the CA in the NSS database actually used by the bundled
  Playwright Chromium. Discover and document the applicable database rather
  than assuming browser verification from system trust alone.
- Configure Python HTTPS libraries to use the combined system CA bundle, for
  example through the stable container environment:

  ```text
  SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
  ```

- Preserve the existing public roots and mitmproxy CA while adding the host
  mkcert CA.
- Do not inspect or install the CA at container startup. A missing or invalid
  publication becomes a concise ensure-command failure with remediation to run
  orchestration `./setup.sh` on the host.
- Add an idempotent read-only trust verifier that reports:
  - publication file missing or invalid
  - system trust missing or stale
  - Python bundle not configured
  - Chromium/NSS trust missing or stale
- Update workspace `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, or the closest setup/trust
  documentation so agents working in `orchestration` or
  `budget-analyzer-api-tests` know when to run the ensure command and when to
  stop for host publication.

### Non-goals

- Do not generate a new mkcert CA or ingress certificate in the container.
- Do not mount or copy `rootCA-key.pem`.
- Do not add browser flags that ignore certificate errors.
- Do not replace verified HTTPS with HTTP.
- Do not add Budget Analyzer target behavior to generic AI launch wrappers.
- Do not require the local Budget Analyzer stack merely to start the
  devcontainer.
- Do not run the ensure command from the devcontainer entrypoint, startup
  hooks, or shell initialization.

### Required context

- `AGENTS.md`
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- `ai-agent-sandbox/docker-compose.yml`
- `ai-agent-sandbox/Dockerfile`
- `ai-agent-sandbox/entrypoint.sh`
- existing mitmproxy CA installation and environment behavior
- `README.md`
- Phase 1's deterministic publication contract
- the workspace-owned executable plan at
  [`lazy-local-ca-trust-installation-plan.md`](../../../workspace/docs/plans/lazy-local-ca-trust-installation-plan.md)

### Implementation notes

- The shared repositories are already mounted under the workspace, so prefer
  the deterministic published file over an OS-specific host-home bind mount.
- Keep `SSL_CERT_FILE` pointed at a combined bundle, not at the mkcert root
  alone, so public HTTPS endpoints remain trusted.
- The ensure command may update container-local trust databases; it must not
  modify the host CA file.
- Use a fixed NSS certificate nickname and replace a stale fingerprint
  idempotently after host CA rotation.
- The verifier must never print certificate private-key paths, session values,
  or unrelated environment secrets.
- Run narrow system-store operations through `sudo`, but create and update the
  NSS database as the container user that launches Playwright Chromium.
- Keep `SSL_CERT_FILE` as image-level environment configuration because a child
  ensure process cannot modify the environment of its calling shell.

### Validation

Static validation from a writable checkout of the workspace repository:

```bash
docker compose -f ai-agent-sandbox/docker-compose.yml config
shellcheck ai-agent-sandbox/scripts/ensure-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust.sh
shellcheck ai-agent-sandbox/scripts/check-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust.sh
```

After Phase 1, rebuild the devcontainer image once for the workspace tooling,
then publish or rotate the host CA without restarting the running container and
run:

```bash
ensure-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust
check-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust
openssl verify \
  -CAfile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt \
  ../orchestration/nginx/certs/k8s/_wildcard.budgetanalyzer.localhost.pem
curl --fail-with-body https://app.budgetanalyzer.localhost/
python -c 'import httpx; print(httpx.get("https://app.budgetanalyzer.localhost/api/v1/currencies").status_code)'
```

Run an uncredentialed Playwright smoke navigation to
`https://app.budgetanalyzer.localhost/` without `ignore_https_errors`, then run
the ensure command and verifier a second time to prove idempotency.

### Completion criteria

- A rebuilt agent image contains the lazy ensure command, read-only verifier,
  NSS tooling, and stable Python trust-bundle configuration.
- An already-running agent container trusts a newly published or rotated host
  CA after one explicit ensure invocation, without a restart.
- Curl and Python/httpx reach the local ingress with normal verification.
- Playwright Chromium loads the local HTTPS origin without ignoring
  certificate errors.
- Public Internet certificates continue to validate.
- Repeated ensure/trust checks make no unnecessary changes and report the
  same trusted fingerprint.
- Missing publication produces a clear ensure-command prerequisite failure
  rather than a startup failure or insecure fallback.
- No private CA material enters the container or repository.

## Phase 3: API Tests Bootstrap Local Trust And Preflight Live Runs

### Goal

Remove target-configurable TLS verification, invoke the workspace lazy trust
installer for the exact local target, and add one early, actionable
prerequisite result before selected tests or tools attempt live API traffic.

### Scope

- Remove `verify_tls` from:
  - all environment YAML files
  - typed environment configuration and normalized non-secret settings
  - `GatewayClient` construction
  - browser-login construction
  - tests, documentation, workflow inputs, and artifact schemas
- Require supported environment origins to use `https`.
- Let httpx use normal verified TLS and the runner's configured trust store.
- Ensure Playwright never enables `ignore_https_errors`.
- Add typed preflight logic and a thin CLI at:

  ```text
  tools/check-live-prerequisites.py
  ```

- Treat the same CLI and typed preflight path as the API-test live bootstrap.
  After resolving and validating the target but before opening the network:
  - when `environment_type == "local"`, the origin is exactly
    `https://app.budgetanalyzer.localhost`, and
    `ensure-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust` is available on `PATH`, invoke it
    once and stop on any nonzero result
  - when the workspace command is unavailable, continue with ordinary verified
    TLS so host-native and other correctly configured local runners remain
    supported
  - never invoke the local ensure command for staging, production, aliases,
    origin overrides, or arbitrary HTTPS targets

- Support explicit prerequisite scopes without changing TLS behavior:
  - `public`: verified origin, ingress, ext_authz edge, and public API docs
  - `authenticated`: public checks plus all prerequisites required by the
    configured primary session-acquisition path
  - `authorization`: authenticated checks plus a usable secondary session path
- Add an explicit `--require-local-target` safety option to the preflight CLI
  and pytest plugin for this plan's agent-run acceptance. When selected,
  validate the resolved configuration rather than trusting the `--env local`
  label alone: require `environment_type == "local"` and the exact origin
  `https://app.budgetanalyzer.localhost`. Refuse staging, production, aliases,
  and origin overrides before reading any credential or opening the network.
  This option constrains the target; it must not change TLS behavior.
- Distinguish and report at least:
  - invalid environment configuration or non-HTTPS origin
  - DNS resolution failure
  - connection refusal/timeout suggesting Tilt or the target cluster is down
  - certificate issuer, hostname, expiry, or trust-chain failure
  - missing or invalid host CA publication and failed lazy trust installation
  - ingress/backend readiness failure
  - unexpected unauthenticated gateway behavior
  - missing configured credential/session environment-variable names
- Report all missing variables for the selected acquisition path in one result,
  without reading them into artifacts or printing their values.
- Integrate preflight with pytest after collection but before network-capable
  fixture setup:
  - infer the highest required scope from selected live tests and fixtures
  - do not preflight `--collect-only`
  - do not preflight offline harness/unit tests or snapshot-only tools
  - run once per pytest session, not once per test
- Make live OpenAPI/refresh tools call the public preflight path before fetching
  the deployed document.
- Return documented stable exit codes from the standalone preflight CLI.
- Add deterministic unit tests using `httpx.MockTransport`, `monkeypatch`, and
  pytester; mock command discovery and execution so unit tests prove local-only
  lazy bootstrap without changing a real trust store or calling the live
  target.
- Update `AGENTS.md` so exact-local live work uses the prerequisite/bootstrap
  entry point, missing publication is escalated to host orchestration setup,
  and certificate-verification bypasses remain forbidden.
- Update `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, environment validation documentation, and
  any generated artifact contract affected by removal of `verify_tls`.

### Non-goals

- Do not add `--insecure`, `--no-verify`, agent-container detection, or any
  equivalent TLS bypass.
- Do not implement certificate installation in this repository; invoke only
  the workspace-owned command when it is available and the exact-local target
  gate has passed.
- Do not make offline collection depend on Tilt, DNS, TLS, credentials, or
  network access.
- Do not start Tilt or mutate Kubernetes from preflight.
- Do not acquire sessions for public-only tools.
- Do not log cookies, passwords, authorization headers, or browser storage.
- Do not convert expected test assertion failures into prerequisite failures.

### Required context

- repository `AGENTS.md`
- `environments/*.yaml`
- `src/api_tests/config.py`
- `src/api_tests/client.py`
- `src/api_tests/browser_login.py`
- `src/api_tests/auth.py`
- `src/api_tests/pytest_plugin.py`
- `src/api_tests/tools/`
- `tools/`
- harness/tool/config tests
- completed Phases 1 and 2 of this plan
- the blocked provider-neutral completion plan

### Implementation notes

- Keep network exception parsing at the httpx boundary and translate expected
  failures into concise typed results.
- Keep command discovery and subprocess execution behind a typed, mockable
  boundary. Do not use shell command strings.
- Resolve and validate `environment_type` and origin before command discovery,
  credential reads, trust-store mutation, or network access.
- Use public gateway requests only. Preflight must not query Kubernetes,
  service DNS, databases, Redis, RabbitMQ, or service health endpoints.
- A useful public readiness proof is:
  - verified HTTPS succeeds
  - unauthenticated `GET /api/v1/currencies` returns the exact expected edge
    status and non-HTML response
  - `GET /api-docs/openapi.json` returns the expected public JSON document
- If browser credentials are configured and the current acquisition
  implementation eagerly requires both users, report all four missing
  username/password variables rather than stopping at the first one.
- Keep prerequisite diagnostics separate from redacted request artifacts.

### Validation

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m ruff format --check .
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .
.venv/bin/python -m mypy src tests
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --env local tests/tools tests/contract tests/auth -q
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --env local --collect-only
.venv/bin/python tools/check-openapi-coverage.py --env local --fail-missing --fail-placeholder
.venv/bin/python tools/check-live-prerequisites.py --help
```

Unit tests must prove that the workspace ensure command is invoked exactly once
for the exact local target, that its failure stops before network access, that
an unavailable command falls through to normal verified TLS, and that staging,
production, aliases, and overrides never invoke it.

With host Tilt healthy and Phase 2 trust installed:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/check-live-prerequisites.py --env local --scope public --require-local-target
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --env local --require-local-target \
  tests/auth/test_edge_auth.py \
  tests/contract/test_unknown_routes.py
```

Stop Tilt or use mocked tests to verify that unavailable-target, TLS, gateway,
and authentication failures each produce one clear prerequisite result without
a traceback or secret value.

### Completion criteria

- `verify_tls` and every insecure TLS execution path are absent from active
  configuration, code, docs, and workflows.
- Supported live origins require HTTPS.
- `--require-local-target` fails before credentials or network access unless
  the resolved target is the exact local Budget Analyzer origin.
- Verified local requests succeed from the trusted agent container.
- The exact-local live bootstrap invokes the workspace ensure command when it
  is available and reports its failures before network or credential access.
- Non-local targets and runners without the workspace helper retain ordinary
  verified-TLS behavior without local trust-store mutation.
- A selected live pytest run performs one automatic preflight before client or
  session fixtures.
- Collection and offline tests perform no live preflight.
- The CLI distinguishes target-down, TLS, gateway-readiness, and
  authentication-prerequisite failures.
- Unit tests cover each error category without a real target.
- API-test agent guidance names the lazy exact-local bootstrap and its host
  remediation without instructing agents to run host certificate setup.
- No prerequisite output or artifact exposes secrets.

## Phase 4: Cross-Repository Acceptance And Plan Handoff

### Goal

Prove the complete host-to-container trust path against a healthy Tilt stack,
then explicitly unblock the provider-neutral API coverage plan.

### Scope

- Confirm Phase 1 host publication and Phase 2 lazy container ensure/trust
  checks pass for the same CA fingerprint without restarting the container
  after publication.
- Start or confirm the local Tilt stack from the host; do not start Tilt from
  the agent container.
- From the agent container, verify the shared Kind cluster and public HTTPS
  ingress are reachable without a TLS bypass.
- Run the API test preflight for public, authenticated, and authorization
  scopes as available and prove its exact-local bootstrap invokes the workspace
  ensure command before network access. Supply only disposable local test
  credentials through environment variables. Environment variables prevent
  persistence in config; they do not make values confidential from the agent.
- Run the blocked Phase 5 public edge tests and authenticated behavioral suites.
- Record any real endpoint assertion failures as API/product issues rather than
  trust-store prerequisites.
- Update active operator documentation so the supported topology is explicit:

  ```text
  host Tilt/Kind + host mkcert CA
      -> published public root CA
      -> lazy workspace ensure command
      -> trusted agent-container system/Python/Chromium paths
      -> verified HTTPS public gateway tests
  ```

- Mark this prerequisite plan complete only after the public live acceptance
  path passes. Then resume Phase 5 of the provider-neutral completion plan
  without rerunning its completed Phases 1 through 4.

### Non-goals

- Do not make agent-container Tilt startup part of the supported workflow.
- Do not bypass TLS for diagnostics or acceptance.
- Do not broaden mutation, destructive, staging, or production permissions.
- Do not mark provider-neutral Phase 5 complete if its behavioral assertions
  have not passed.
- Do not treat missing credentials as a harness defect.

### Required context

- completion evidence from Phases 1 through 3
- healthy host-managed Tilt resources
- pre-provisioned browser users or supplied opaque sessions
- `budget-analyzer-api-tests/.ai-session-handler/` state for the blocked plan
- provider-neutral Phase 5 validation and completion criteria

### Implementation notes

- Keep host-only and container-only commands clearly separated in the handoff.
- Before any acceptance command, prove the API-test configuration resolves to
  `environment_type: local` with the exact origin
  `https://app.budgetanalyzer.localhost`. Before host-side cluster inspection
  or mutation, also prove the active context is `kind-kind` and the expected
  host Kind cluster is named `kind`. If an in-container cluster check is added,
  use the context, referenced cluster, loopback API endpoint, and
  `kind-control-plane` node checks instead of `kind get clusters`. Stop on any
  mismatch.
- Compare public CA fingerprints rather than relying only on filenames.
- Acceptance should invoke `ensure-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust` explicitly
  once, then prove the API-test prerequisite path safely repeats that ensure
  automatically and idempotently for the exact local target.
- The existing AI Session Handler state is runner-owned. Do not edit it
  manually; resume or re-accept the revised provider-neutral plan through the
  handler's supported workflow.
- Because the provider-neutral Markdown plan changed while Phase 5 was
  stopped, its next handler invocation must use both `--accept-plan-change` and
  `--retry-stopped` after this prerequisite phase completes.
- If authenticated credentials are intentionally unavailable, public trust and
  edge acceptance may be proven, but this phase remains incomplete until the
  provider-neutral Phase 5 live behavioral suite can run.

### Validation

On the host:

```bash
test "$(kubectl config current-context)" = "kind-kind"
kind get clusters | grep -Fx "kind"
tilt get uiresources
kubectl get pods -A
```

In the agent container:

```bash
ensure-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust
check-budget-analyzer-local-ca-trust
.venv/bin/python tools/check-live-prerequisites.py --env local --scope public --require-local-target
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --env local --require-local-target \
  tests/auth/test_edge_auth.py \
  tests/contract/test_unknown_routes.py
.venv/bin/python tools/check-live-prerequisites.py --env local --scope authenticated --require-local-target
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --env local --require-local-target \
  tests/transactions tests/statement_formats tests/views
```

When secondary prerequisites are available:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/check-live-prerequisites.py --env local --scope authorization --require-local-target
```

### Completion criteria

- Host and container report the same trusted public CA fingerprint.
- Host CA publication or rotation becomes usable in the already-running
  container without a restart.
- Curl, Python/httpx, and Playwright validate the local ingress without bypass
  options.
- Public preflight lazily ensures trust and gateway edge tests pass against
  host-managed Tilt.
- Authenticated Phase 5 behavioral tests run after one clear prerequisite
  result and reach actual endpoint assertions.
- Documentation assigns host certificate publication, container trust, and
  test preflight to the correct repositories.
- The provider-neutral completion plan is explicitly unblocked at Phase 5.
